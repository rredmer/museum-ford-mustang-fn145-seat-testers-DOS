The Ford Motor Company FN145 Mustang and Lincoln Town Car End of Line Seat Testers (Motorola 1995)

## Introduction
This project showcases the FN145 Mustang and Lincoln Town Car End of Line Seat Testers developed by Motorola in 1995 based on code developed by Ronald Redmer in 1992. These testers were used to ensure the quality and functionality of the seats before they left the production line. In 1998, Ford Motor Company contracted Ronald Redmer to support, maintain, and enhance the software to support new seat modules, new heating pads, etc. In 2001, Ford Motor Company contracted Redmer Controls to design and manufacture new seat testers for this production line which included the first heating & cooling systems in automotive seating.
